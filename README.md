# Photoshoot helper bot

Telegram bot made in Rust to quickly fetch heterogeneous information to plan a shooting, from sample images for the location to weather data.
Born for astrophotography and nighttime shooting, might grow into something bigger down the line.

Right now only basic placeholder commands are working, documentation will be updated once more complex functions get added.
